XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -name sys_clock -waveform {0.000 5.000} [get_ports sys_clock] (Source: /home/monx/Projects/FIFO_USB/USB_FIFO.srcs/constrs_1/imports/REVO/REVO1.xdc (Line: 305))

Related violations: <none>

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -name sys_clock -waveform {0.000 5.000} [get_ports sys_clock] (Source: /home/monx/Projects/FIFO_USB/USB_FIFO.srcs/constrs_1/imports/REVO/REVO1.xdc (Line: 305))
